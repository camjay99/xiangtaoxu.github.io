Welcome to the GEM lab in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell](https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/)! We investigate ecological dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems under rapid global environmental change. We use various quantitative and computational tools such as terrestrial biosphere modeling and environmental remote sensing.
