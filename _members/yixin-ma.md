I am broadly interested in how plants interact with environmental variability (both temporally and spatially), and my research centers on phenotypic plasticity, i.e., within-species trait variability driven by different environments. I approach this topic using techniques in ecological modeling and ecophysiology. My current research examines light-driven plasticity within the canopy and how it relates to demography and fitness.
