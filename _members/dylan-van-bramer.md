Iâ€™m a junior studying Computer Science, with a passion for machine learning and data science, and their applications to ecology. At the Xu Lab, in a collaboration with the Gomes Lab, I am working on machine learning models for forest ecology. Exploring both deep learning and ensemble methods, we are learning about neighborhood interactions between species using forest census data. I am excited to continue learning about both machine learning and ecology throughout my time here.
